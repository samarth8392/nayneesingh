</div>

Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working with esteemed organizations such as the [National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences](https://nimhans.ac.in/) (NIMHANS), Bengaluru and the [Cosmos Institute of Mental Health & Behavioural Sciences](https://www.cimbs.in/) (CIMBS), New Delhi. In the role of a Psychiatric Social Worker (PSW), I have provided therapeutic support, case management, and community outreach services to individuals and families facing mental health challenges.

My experience extends beyond clinical practice to include program coordination and community development initiatives. As a former Programme Coordinator at [Udayan Care](https://www.udayancare.org/), I led efforts to empower vulnerable populations and promote social inclusion. Additionally, my tenure as an Assistant Project Coordinator at [Urmul Seemant Samiti](https://seemant.org/) allowed me to spearhead projects focused on early childhood care and education, emphasizing holistic development and well-being.

In my current role, I am privileged to continue my journey at the forefront of mental health care, collaborating with interdisciplinary teams to deliver personalized, compassionate care to those in need. My approach is rooted in evidence-based practices, cultural sensitivity, and a deep respect for the dignity and autonomy of every individual.

Outside of my professional endeavors, I am passionate about ongoing learning and advocacy efforts to reduce stigma and increase access to mental health services. I am committed to fostering dialogue, raising awareness, and driving positive change in our communities.
