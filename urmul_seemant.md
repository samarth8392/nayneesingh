Urmul Seemant Samiti has been dedicated to empowering village communities towards self-reliance since its establishment in 1994. The organization aims to create a safe and enabling environment that ensures the rights to health, education, and employment are respected and realized without discrimination or exclusion, with a special focus on children and women. This mission is rooted in the belief that every individual deserves access to essential services that can improve their quality of life and foster community development.

The story of Urmul Seemant Samiti began in 1984 with the URMUL Rural Health Research and Development Trust (URMUL Trust), which started as a social development initiative for farmers associated with the cooperative dairy, Urmul Dairy, in Bikaner. Inspired by the community-based developmental services initiated by AMUL, URMUL Trust focused on addressing the needs of disadvantaged groups, particularly women and children, to alleviate their hardships and advance their rights. Over time, the organization recognized that the impoverished populations in the desert region required a broader range of services, particularly in health, education, and livelihood.

In May 1988, URMUL Trust expanded its activities to the command area of the Indira Gandhi Canal in Kolayat Block of Bikaner district, aiming to provide community-based developmental services to the scattered desert population. By 1992, the organization began decentralizing its activities, transferring authority and responsibility to local communities. This process led to the formation of Urmul Seemant Samiti on May 4, 1994, which is now operational in the Bikaner and Jodhpur districts of western Rajasthan, directly impacting over 300 villages.

Within this impactful framework, my role involved contributing to the formulation and implementation of Plan India's Early Childhood Care and Development project. This initiative aligns closely with Urmul Seemant Samiti's mission to empower vulnerable communities, particularly focusing on the early development of children. I assisted in developing project plans, including timelines and resource allocations, to ensure optimal efficiency in our efforts.

A significant aspect of my work was facilitating training for beneficiaries, including pregnant and lactating mothers, Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs), Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), and Anganwadi workers (AWWs). By equipping these individuals with the necessary knowledge and skills, I aimed to enhance the overall effectiveness of the project and improve the health and well-being of children in the community.

Additionally, I contributed to surveys, budget spreadsheets, and Gantt charts for the analysis and assessment of project performance. This analytical work was crucial for understanding the impact of our initiatives and ensuring that we remained accountable to our goals. I also had the responsibility of preparing the Annual Report for the Early Childhood Care and Development project for the year 2015, which provided a comprehensive overview of our achievements and challenges.

My role at Urmul Seemant Samiti was deeply intertwined with the organization's mission to empower communities and improve the lives of vulnerable populations. Through my contributions to the Early Childhood Care and Development project, I played a part in advancing the rights and well-being of children and families in western Rajasthan. It was a privilege to be involved in such meaningful work, helping to create a brighter future for those in need.
